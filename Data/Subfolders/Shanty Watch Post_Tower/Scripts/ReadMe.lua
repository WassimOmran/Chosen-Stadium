Damage Part or Wood Spike Trap by NoobDadGamer - Special Thanks to Marious0423 for the Campfire damage CC part!

Interchange any of your parts that you want to cause damage into the WOOD SPIKE TRAP *PART* folder and rename 
whatever you like.

The amount of damage caused and the rate at which it is caused is adjustable from the "Properties" 
tab after selecting "Damage Trigger" from the Hierchy.

To verify that your part will work - Go to The "Core Content" tab 
and select, "Game Components" -> "UI" -> and drag "Health Bar" onto the screen. 
When you press play, you can verify that your player takes damage when colliding with the part. 

***Remember to press V so you can see the actual trigger collision box that causes the damage. 

Hope this CC template and the ReadMe helps any new people like myself. 

Again, Thanks to Marious0423 for providing the basis of this template. 

Enjoy 
NDG
