Shanty Watch Tower by NoobDadGamer

The wooden traps at the base of the tower will cause damage to players. 

To disable this - Delete the "Wood Spike - Damage Part" files from the bottom of the model. 

To test - Import the "Health Bar" from Core Content and press play. 

Damage continues as long as the player stands in the trigger. Damage is adjustable. 

Ladder and Controls by Kirch - Thank you ! - You can change or delete if you wish. 

Enjoy - More to come!
